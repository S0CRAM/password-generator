# Password Generator
## By S0CRAM
With the use of the String library as well as the random library from Python, I created a very simple and basic password generator. 

There are two options:
- Alphabets, Numbers
- Alphabets, Numbers, Punctuation (Special Characters)


The string library was used for getting the necessary lists for alphabets, numbers, and punctuation. 


Using the random library, I used it to make a choice on every loop that decides which list to pull a character from. Afterwards, the program will choose a character from the chosen list "randomly" and appends to the `password` variable.

**This should not be used to replace an actual password generator**, this is moreso a learning experience for me in how they may be created.
